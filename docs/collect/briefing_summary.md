# Summary:

## Goals:

1.	Make intercontinental space travel a reality.
2.	The customer Journey; Offerings and features of the service, explore destination cities, learn about Starports (locations), compare Co2 footprint, regulations and commercial space travel.
3.	The booking process; Transit options, contract containing risks, liability and health. 

Booking platform will need to accommodate this complexity while also providing customers with a user-friendly experience.
4.	Starpoint locations will be in strategic areas near major cities, for easy access for passengers.
5.	A separate system will be used to handle the Starport Transit Hubs, which will provide transportation to and from starports. Also used to allow the customer to book their transit option witch will be included in the price.
6.	The flight scheduling system; rocket flight booking platform. His system needs to be efficient, user friendly and adaptable to accommodate the rocket flight schedules. 
7.	The flight scheduling system will managed through a calendar interface, allowing the crew to mark time slots for available flights easily. 
8.	The system should allow planning a departure after an arrival, ensuring the rocket is available at the launch pad. 
9.	Maintenance; the scheduling system should have a feature to mark specific flights as repair flights.
10.	If maintenance is scheduled; block the event schedule for that duration, ensuring no rocket can land on the launch pad during this time.
11.	Capacity management; the crew should get to manage the passenger capacity for each flight. This feature will help ensure that SpaceX can effectively manage the number of passengers on each rocket, maintaining a comfortable and luxurious travel experience.
